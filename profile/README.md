## Introduction
This project, a part of the #GenerasiGIGIH program, aims to address the challenge of low literacy rates among students in Indonesia through the optimal utilization of school libraries via a web platform.

## Problem Statement
Despite having over 113,000 school libraries in Indonesia, these facilities have not been effectively used to enhance student literacy. This project seeks to transform these underutilized spaces into active literacy centers.

## Audience / Target User Group
Our primary audience includes schools in Indonesia, particularly teachers and students at various educational levels, and school administrators involved in library management.

## Project Goals and Objectives
The main goal is to improve student literacy in Indonesia by:
- Transforming school libraries into active literacy centers.
- Integrating technology to provide digital access to libraries.
- Developing a web platform to enhance library usage and literacy programs.

## Platform Description
The centerpiece of our project is a web-based platform designed to revitalize school libraries. Key features include:
- **Digital Access to Library Collections**: Easy online access to a wide range of books and educational resources.
- **Hybrid Service Model**: Combines the traditional physical library with digital capabilities, offering a comprehensive learning experience.
- **Interactive Literacy Programs**: Includes reading clubs, writing communities, and research groups to engage students actively.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for simplicity and ease of use by students, teachers, and library staff.
- **Resource Management Tools**: For librarians and teachers to effectively manage library resources and track student engagement.
- **Remote Accessibility**: Ensures students can access the library resources from anywhere, anytime, supporting continuous learning.

## Methodology
Our approach includes:
- Conducting need analysis through surveys and interviews.
- Developing a web literacy platform with user-friendly features.
- Implementing hybrid services combining physical and digital library aspects.

## Expected Results
We anticipate:
- Significant improvement in student literacy levels.
- Increased active use of school libraries.
- Enhanced library management and digital access.
- Growth in student reading interest.
